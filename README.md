[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Description

This is your classic to-do list. Enter in the task you want to complete. As you go along in your day, you can delete a task once it is no longer necessary. Once you complete a task, you can click on the empty box button and it will complete the task. This 'complete' button is reversable so if you accidently complete a task, you can reverse that decision. However, once a task is deleted it can never be reversed. 

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
